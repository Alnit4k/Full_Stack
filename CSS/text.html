    <p  style="color: brown;">Galaxies that helped transform the early universe may have 
        been small, round and green.</p>

    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have spotted 
        “Green Pea” galaxies dating to 13.1 billion years ago. 
        These viridescent runts, spotted just 700 million years 
        after the Big Bang, might have helped trigger one of the 
        greatest makeovers in cosmic history, astronomers said at 
        a January 9 news conference in Seattle at the American 
        Astronomical Society’s annual meeting.</p>

    <p style="text-decoration:line-through">Green Peas first showed up in 2009 in images from the Sloan
         Digital Sky Survey, an ambitious project to map much of 
         the sky. Citizen science volunteers gave the objects their
        colorful name. Their greenish hue is because most of their
        light comes from glowing gas clouds, rather than directly 
        from stars.</p>

    <p style="text-decoration:solid; color: blueviolet;">These galaxies are rare in the present-day universe. 
        Astronomers think that the ones that do exist are analogs 
        of galaxies that were more plentiful in the early universe.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center ;">  “They’re a bit like living fossils,” said astrophysicist James
         Rhoads of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
          Md. “Coelacanths, if you will,” referencing a fish thought 
          to be extinct until it showed up off the coast of South 
          Africa in 1938 (SN: 12/2/11).

    <p>These galaxies leak much more ultraviolet light, which can rip electrons
         from atoms, than typical galaxies do. So Green Peas dating to the universe’s 
         first billion years or so could be partly responsible for a dramatic and mysterious 
         cosmic transition called reionization, when most of the hydrogen atoms in the 
         early universe had their electrons torn away (SN: 1/7/20).
